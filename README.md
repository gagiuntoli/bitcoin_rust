# Bitcoin Rust

This Rust library is aimed to allow the interaction with the Bitcoin network. It
is a project built based on the [Programming
Bitcoin](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-bitcoin/9781492031482/)
book by Jimmy Song. The goal is to learn as deeply as possible how Bitcoin works.

The main capability it is intended to offers are:

 - [ ] Finite Fields
 - [ ] Elliptic curves (secp256k1) cryptography
 - [ ] Serialization: public keys, signatures, transactions

## Disclaimer

Please don't use this code on mainnet. It is just a didactic exercise and not
intended for production purposes.
